A [hacker][hacker] is one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing the limitations of programming systems. And in doing so, tries to extend their capabilities.

The act of programming in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking.

<!--more-->

However the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but the manner in which it is done: Hacking entails some form of excellence, for example exploring the limits of what is possible, thereby doing something exciting and meaningful.

Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have "hack value" and are termed hacks.
