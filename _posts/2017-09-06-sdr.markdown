# Getting started with Software Defined Radio (SDR)

_**How to move on from the FM radio examples**_

  1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing
     you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows
     you to solve a larger problem.

Getting started with Software Defined Radio (SDR) is increasingly difficult once you want to move on from capturing and demodulated FM Radio to demodulating and decoding other radio signals.

Hardware, software, physics, jargon. It can be intimidating. Putting some examples in one place that can be run by someone with a moderate understanding of computers will hopefully inspire and enable them to get started without too much difficulty.

I've put these scripts into a my [SDR repository](https://github.com/gyaresu/sdr) on GitHub and will update them as time permits.

These scripts will only require the bootable GNURadio LiveUSB version of Ubuntu and an SDR device such as the HackRF One, RTL-SDR etc.

Have fun!
