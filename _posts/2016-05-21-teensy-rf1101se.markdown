## Driving the RF1101SE-v3.1 with a Teensy microcontroller

This week I spent a couple of days fighting with, testing, and then finally releasing some working code that drives a [Texas Instruments CC1101][cc1101] based board with the fabulous [Teensy][teensy] from [PJRC][pjrc]. I also include some code to configure Michael Ossmann's [Yard Stick One][ys1] which has become an indespensible device for working with packet-based radios.

It was a whole lot of fun and a real break from a work projects that have consumed my last 6 months.

The RF1101SE is a generic [Texas Instruments CC1101][cc1101] based board with capacitors and parts limiting the effective frequency range to 433MHz.

If you want to get a Teensy then the best place to source one is while ordering Open Source Hardware circuit boards from [OSHPark.com][oshpark]

Or you can [order a Teensy directly][order] for about US$20 delivered worldwide.

I <3 [OSH Park][oshpark]. They're awesome
