# Things of the internet

Back in the olden days of the early 2000's computers were still either the beige box on your desk, the black laptop in your bag or the aptly nicknamed "Barbie's toilet seat" iBook. 

You probably also had some version of a Nokia phone with its blue/green/monochrome LCD display and GSM radio tranciever which was your other magical device.

Now the phone was locked down and pretty much single purpose in the sense you could make calls and send SMS which is all part of the GSM spec.

If you knew how to pimp your computer then you might be able to acheive 900MHz of raw general purpose computing **POWER**.

Flash forward to now and the power and functionality of that general purpose computer and those locked-down radio trancievers (mobile phones) have combined into a chip no bigger than your fingernail.

And it's only getting more freaky-awesome.
