2012 — August 2015 [Greenpeace International][gpi] - Local IT Team Leader

From a challenging start I worked with HR to amicably restaff our team of four with folks holding contemporary technical proficiency which enabled an immediate improvement in not only typical areas of IT responsibilities but increased our team’s capacity to provide services, systems, training, on-site solutions, and support for other areas of not just GPI, but also NROs and units well outside the usual jurisdiction. Non-traditional roles such as NRO on-site support, GPI Project management technical support, assessment, and testing. Extra capacity enabled us to do ships technical support, Global meeting support, and a complete computer systems overhaul for the Exeter Science Unit. My time with GPI was limited to a maximum of 3 years due to GPI restructuring rules. I immediately moved into doing Action-Tech contracts with global Greenpeace offices and campaigns.

Full-service, contracted, IT support for thousands of personal and business clients over nine years.
Running my own business and being solely responsible for every technology stack I built and/or supported has given me the confidence and diverse range of skills to tackle almost any area of technology today. Being confident of my ability to skill-up in a reasonable time has come from the demand of live production environments.

   sheer range of business requirements and solutions I've been directly
